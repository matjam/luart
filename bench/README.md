# Benchmarks

Two benchmarks run the same Lua source in every interpreter: apogee without
the JIT (`WithoutJIT`), apogee with it (the default), Shopify/go-lua, and C
Lua 5.5 or LuaJIT when built with their tag (see
[C interpreters](#c-interpreters)).

- **`BenchmarkSuite`** ([`suite_test.go`](suite_test.go)) runs eleven
  workloads chosen for what an embedded Lua does: calls, loops, tables,
  closures, sorting, building and scanning strings, and calls into Go.
  Each is also written in native Go, which the interpreters are compared
  with.
- **`BenchmarkStandard`** ([`standard_test.go`](standard_test.go)) runs the
  14 benchmarks of Are We Fast Yet and three from the Computer Language
  Benchmarks Game, which other language implementations are measured with
  ([`standard/`](standard)). The interpreters are compared with C Lua 5.5,
  the language apogee speaks.

`TestSuiteAgrees` and `TestStandardAgrees` check that every interpreter
computes the same results. The tables and charts come from the raw output
by [`chart`](chart) (see [Reproducing](#reproducing)).

- apogee with the JIT takes 0.73 times as long as C Lua 5.5 on the
  geometric mean. It is faster on 15 of the 17, most on numeric code and
  method calls (fannkuch-redux, Bounce, Queens, spectral-norm, Permute and
  NBody), level on Json, and 1.1 times as long on CD, which allocates
  most.
- Without the JIT, apogee takes 1.8 times as long as C Lua 5.5.
- LuaJIT is about 5.5 times faster than C Lua 5.5 on the geometric mean.
- go-lua takes six times as long as C Lua 5.5, and 69 times on
  DeltaBlue. It does not finish Havlak in ten minutes, so it has no result
  there, and its geometric mean is of the other 16.

## arm64

Apple M1 Pro, macOS, Go 1.27.1, `-count 6`, `-ldflags=-funcalign=64`,
medians, 2026-09-25, at commit d5dba73. Lua 5.4.9 and LuaJIT 2.1.1788856981
from Homebrew (`lua@5.4`, `luajit`). These results predate the port to
Lua 5.5 and are still against C Lua 5.4. The machine was not idle, so
single results vary more than on amd64. Raw output:
[`suite-results.txt`](suite-results.txt).

- Sort with a comparator runs about as fast with the JIT as without it.
  Go calls the comparator, which returns after two instructions, so it
  is interpreted: entering compiled code and returning to Go costs about
  10 ns here, more than the instructions. Entered anyway, it took 6.90
  ms against 5.76 ms.

- apogee with the JIT takes 0.75 times as long as C Lua 5.4 on the
  geometric mean, and is faster on 15 of the 17; CD takes as long, and
  binary-trees, which allocates most, 1.1 times as long.
- Without the JIT, apogee takes 1.5 times as long as C Lua 5.4.
- Relative to C Lua 5.4, both apogee and LuaJIT do better here than on
  amd64. The two machines' C Lua 5.4 are different builds (Homebrew and
  Arch Linux), so compare their ratios with care.

## Allocations

The JIT allocates exactly what the interpreter does. Allocations are per
run of each suite workload.

| Workload | apogee allocations | go-lua allocations |
|---|---|---|
| fib(25) | 0 | 318,000 |
| numeric loop | 0 | 4,857,000 |
| array fill and sum | 22 | 500,000 |
| records | 10,000 | 120,000 |
| closures | 100,000 | 900,000 |
| sort | 17 | 180,000 |
| string build | 10,000 | 80,000 |
| string scan | 0 | 71,000 |
| calls into Go | 0 | 400,000 |
| plasma frame | 0 | 280,000 |
| particles frame | 0 | 25,000 |

## Notes

- Plasma is a 200×100 per-pixel effect with three `math.sin` calls and one
  call into Go per pixel. Particles moves 2,000 particle tables by a method
  and draws them.
- `TestNumericFrameDoesNotAllocate` keeps numeric code and calls into Go
  allocation-free.
- Numbers, booleans and calls allocate nothing in apogee. The remaining
  allocations are the Lua objects the script creates, one per table,
  closure or string.
- go-lua's numeric loop is slow because its `%` fast path calls
  `math.Mod`, which is far slower than Lua's `a - floor(a/b)*b`.
- The string scan walks 11,000 characters with `s:byte(i)` and
  `s:sub(i, i)`: two calls into Go a character, which the native Go
  version replaces with indexing its compiler folds into a tight loop. It
  shows what calls into Go cost; apogee with the JIT runs it faster than C
  Lua 5.5. It is the suite's newest workload, so its geometric means are
  not comparable with those of earlier runs.
- go-lua's string build is quadratic: its `table.concat` appends with
  `s += str`. apogee's uses a `strings.Builder`.
- The JIT gains least where scripts cross between compiled code and Go
  every few instructions: creating closures, Go calling Lua (the sort
  comparator), and calls into Go. It is fastest on numeric loops and Lua
  calls.
- On amd64 most of plasma's time with the JIT is in compiled code, not in
  its calls to `set`: every Lua register lives in memory, and each store
  checks the write barrier flag in memory.
- `-ldflags=-funcalign=64` keeps the interpreter loop's alignment fixed;
  without it, unrelated changes move timings by 5–10%.
- The native Go versions keep Go's advantages, such as inlined method calls
  in particles, so the gap to Go is widest where Go inlines most.
- Plasma here registers `set` as an ordinary Go function. Registered as a
  number function, which compiled code calls without a Go frame, it takes
  0.74 ms with the JIT (`BenchmarkApogeeNumberFunction`), against 0.77 ms
  (`BenchmarkApogee`). Given the canvas as a buffer, the inner loop runs
  as a kernel, with the `sin` calls inline and its numbers in machine
  registers, and takes 0.25 ms (`BenchmarkApogeeBuffer`), faster than the
  0.30 ms of native Go (amd64, 2026-09-26).
- The C interpreters' calls into Go are calls to C functions, and their
  plasma draws into a C array; the suite's other workloads are the same
  Lua in every interpreter. Their results use integers where Lua 5.4 does,
  which the agreement tests compare as numbers.

## C interpreters

C Lua 5.5, C Lua 5.4 and LuaJIT are linked with cgo, so they need a C
compiler and their development packages, found with pkg-config (`lua5.5`,
`lua5.4` and `luajit`). All define the Lua C API, so a test binary can
link only one. Each has a build tag: `clua55`, `clua54` or `luajit`.
Without one, the benchmarks build with `CGO_ENABLED=0` and run apogee and
go-lua only. C Lua 5.5, the language apogee speaks, is the reference: the
charts compare with it when a results file has it, and with 5.4
otherwise. On macOS, Homebrew's `lua` is 5.5; for 5.4 install `lua@5.4`,
which is keg-only, and set
`PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$(brew --prefix lua@5.4)/lib/pkgconfig`.

## Reproducing

From this directory, on an idle machine, run apogee, go-lua and native Go,
then each C interpreter, into one file:

```sh
CGO_ENABLED=0 go test -run x -bench . -benchmem -count 6 -timeout 3h -ldflags=-funcalign=64 > suite-results-amd64.txt
go test -tags clua55 -run x -bench '.*/.*/lua55$' -benchmem -count 6 -timeout 3h >> suite-results-amd64.txt
go test -tags luajit -run x -bench '.*/.*/luajit$' -benchmem -count 6 -timeout 3h >> suite-results-amd64.txt
go run ./chart -svg suite-amd64.svg -readme README.md -name amd64 suite-results-amd64.txt
go run ./chart -suite standard -svg standard-amd64.svg -readme README.md -name standard-amd64 suite-results-amd64.txt
```

From the median of each benchmark in the file, `-svg` redraws the chart
and `-readme` rewrites the table between `<!-- suite-table NAME -->` and
`<!-- /suite-table -->` in each file; `-table` prints it instead. Name the
file, charts and tables for the machine. On Apple M1 the file is
`suite-results.txt`, and the charts and tables are only in this README:

```sh
go run ./chart -svg suite-arm64-m1.svg -readme README.md -name arm64-m1 suite-results.txt
go run ./chart -suite standard -svg standard-arm64-m1.svg -readme README.md -name standard-arm64-m1 suite-results.txt
```

After either machine's run, `-summary` rewrites the root README's table
of geometric means from both files, a row per benchmark and machine:

```sh
go run ./chart -summary -readme ../README.md -name summary suite-results-amd64.txt suite-results.txt
```
